# QQQ ETF Optimal Buy-Sell Analysis

This project analyzes mock data for the QQQ ETF (Invesco QQQ Trust, which tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index) to find the optimal buy and sell points over a 365-day period. It includes scripts for generating mock data and identifying the most profitable buy-sell combination.

## Features

- Generate mock QQQ ETF price data for a 365-day period
- Identify the optimal buy and sell points to maximize profit
- Visualize the ETF price data with highlighted buy and sell points

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. The following Python libraries are required:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main Python scripts:

1. `generate_mock_data.py`: Generates mock QQQ ETF price data for 365 days.
2. `optimal_buy_sell.py`: Analyzes the generated data to find the optimal buy and sell points.

## Usage

1. Generate mock data:
   Run the `generate_mock_data.py` script to create a CSV file with mock QQQ ETF data:

   ```
   python generate_mock_data.py
   ```

   This will create a file named `mock_qqq_data.csv` in the specified directory.

2. Find optimal buy-sell points:
   Run the `optimal_buy_sell.py` script to analyze the data and find the best buy and sell points:

   ```
   python optimal_buy_sell.py
   ```

   This script will output the optimal buy and sell dates, prices, profit, and profit percentage. It will also generate a chart named `qqq_buy_sell_points.png` visualizing the data and the optimal points.

## Output

The `optimal_buy_sell.py` script will print information like:

```
Optimal buy date: YYYY-MM-DD
Optimal buy price: $XXX.XX
Optimal sell date: YYYY-MM-DD
Optimal sell price: $XXX.XX
Profit: $XXX.XX
Profit percentage: XX.XX%
```

It will also generate a chart (`qqq_buy_sell_points.png`) showing the QQQ ETF price over time with the optimal buy and sell points highlighted.

## Limitations

This project uses a simple algorithm to find a single optimal buy-sell combination that maximizes profit over the entire period. It does not account for:

- Multiple trades
- Trading fees or taxes
- Risk management strategies
- More complex technical or fundamental analysis

In real-world trading scenarios, more sophisticated algorithms and strategies would typically be employed.

## Customization

You can modify the `generate_mock_data.py` script to change parameters like the initial price, daily return distribution, or the time period. The `optimal_buy_sell.py` script can be extended to implement more complex trading strategies or analysis methods.
